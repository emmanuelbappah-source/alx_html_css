# HTML & CSS Advanced Project â€“ Website Layout

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project is a continuation of the **HTML, Advanced** project.  
Here, the focus shifts from the structure of the page to its **style and presentation** using **CSS**.

The goal is to reproduce a professional web page layout based on a **Figma design**, paying attention to typography, colors, spacing, and positioning.  
You will translate the design mockup into clean and maintainable HTML and CSS code.
